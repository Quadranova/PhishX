# Overview
Phishing and social engineering attacks have evolved into one of the most widespread cybersecurity threats affecting individuals and organisations alike. Fraudulent SMS messages, fake banking alerts, malicious links, impersonation scams, and OTP thefts continue to target users who often lack the technical expertise to identify them in time.
**PhishX** is an AI-powered phishing detection and cyber awareness platform designed to help users instantly analyse suspicious messages and screenshots using intelligent threat analysis.

The platform not only detects potential scams, but also:
* Explains why the content is suspicious
* Provides actionable prevention measures
* Educates users through interactive learning modules
* Encourages scam reporting through streamlined workflows

PhishX combines cybersecurity, explainable AI, multilingual accessibility, and user education into a single unified solution.

# Problem Statement
Modern phishing attacks increasingly rely on
* Psychological manipulation
* Impersonation tactics
* Urgency-driven messaging
* Technical deception
* Regional language targeting

Most users:
* Cannot accurately identify phishing attempts
* Do not understand the warning signs
* Lack access to simplified cybersecurity tools
* Hesitate to report incidents due to complexity

Existing solutions are often:
* Too technical for general users
* Limited to spam filtering
* Lacking explainability
* Focused only on detection rather than prevention and awareness

# Our Solution
PhishX addresses these challenges through an AI-driven platform capable of analysing both text-based and image-based phishing attempts. Users can:
* Paste suspicious text messages
* Upload screenshots of chats, emails, or SMS messages
* Receive an AI-generated risk assessment
* Understand the reasoning behind the detection
* Access preventive recommendations
* Learn about scams through educational modules
* Report scams more efficiently

# Key Features
## 🔍 AI-Based Scam Analyzer
Users can submit:

* SMS messages
* WhatsApp conversations
* Emails
* OTP requests
* Fraudulent links
* Suspicious notifications
The AI engine evaluates the content and generates:
### Risk Score
A numerical assessment indicating the severity of the potential threat.
| Risk Score | Threat Level    |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 0–25       | Low Risk        |
| 26–49      | Suspicious      |
| 50–74      | High Risk       |
| 75–100     | Critical Threat |
##  Explainable AI Breakdown
Rather than providing only a classification result, PhishX explains:
* Why the content was flagged
* Which phishing indicators were detected
* Keywords and manipulation patterns identified
* Social engineering techniques involved

Example indicators include:
* Urgency-based language
* Fake authority impersonation

Workflow:
1. OCR extracts textual content from the image
2. AI analyses the extracted data
3. A detailed phishing assessment is generated
This improves accessibility for users who may not be comfortable manually copying text.
##  Pentagon Threat Visualisation
The platform generates a pentagonal threat graph based on five critical phishing dimensions:
| Dimension | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Urgency   | Pressure to act immediately              |
| Technical | Technical deception indicators           |
| Social    | Emotional/social manipulation            |
| Trust     | Impersonation of authority or legitimacy |
| Intent    | Overall malicious intent                 |

This provides users with a more intuitive understanding of the threat profile.
## Preventive Recommendations
PhishX provides actionable mitigation steps based on the detected threat level. Examples include:
* Changing passwords
* Enabling two-factor authentication
* Blocking suspicious senders
* Avoiding malicious links
* Contacting banking support
* Reporting fraudulent activity
The goal is not only detection, but also proactive damage prevention.
